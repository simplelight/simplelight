# Simplelight

This is the original source code of Simplelight, a simple, light CSS framework. The original README.txt is at [Original_README.txt](./Original_README.txt), which contains the following:

```
All the stylesheets are in the Stylesheets folder. Copy and paste ALL of them to the location of your website project files. Only link the simplelight.css file to your HTML file except when you are using Mozilla Thimble, which does not accept @import. Instead, link the other two CSS files to your HTML file. Occasionally, there will be a problem with ChromeOS, where both the stylesheets cannot link. Current examples are in the Examples folder. Open the the simplelight.html file to see how a simplelight based website might look like. Previous versions of simplelight are in the Archives folder. Name Description has been removed in version 2.1. We are now offering minimized stylesheets. To use the minified stylesheets, copy all of the .min.css files to the location of your css files and link your website to the simplelight.min.css file.
